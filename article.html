<h1></h1>Optical Wireless Channel</body>h1>
<p>Optical wireless channels are those channels which use optical wireless bands at the carrier frequency of infrared, visible light and ultraviolet, within the wavelength of 780-106nm, 380-780nm and 10-380nm. These channels help to communicate in indoor, outdoor, underground, and underwater. It exhibits unique features such as nonlinear photoelectric characteristic at both transmitter and receiver ends, complex scattering characteristics for different materials and background noise effects. Due to the absence of multipath fading, Doppler effect, and bandwidth regulation makes optical wireless bands over traditional frequency bands.
